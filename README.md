# object_detection_in_disaster
PROBLEM STATEMENT & OBJECTIVE
To aid the problem of tracking humans   easily & quickly without risking more human lives in desperate times like disasters or terrorist attacks.

“Purpose is to Save Life and 
Save Humanity”

Reasons for loss of life in DISATERS & TERRORIST ATTACKS.

Not quickly recognising the human life in disaster prone areas due to this immediate medical treatment not provided on time.
Also, human involvement require to search life which requires extra human resources, safety equipment, extra cost & time.

The concept of surveillance drones arises to aid the problem of tracking humans quickly without risking more human lives in desperate times like disasters or terrorist attacks. 
The design consists of a Quad-Copter with a object detection camera and GPS to quickly track humans from distance on areas which are not quickly reachable from land and/or are not safe for a human to reach unknowingly. 
The key element here is the detection of humans below rubbles in case of disaster and terrorists attacks. 
Moving Object Detection is a technique used in Artificial Vision. It consists of processing the video so that any object moving within the field of view can be detected. This technique is used to recognize the movement of an object, vehicle, or person through a camera in an autonomous mode and displaying an alarm to the operator.
